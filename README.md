For this assessment, you will have the rest of class to finish.

Using this API: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke, create a joke generator application that gets a joke (setup) and allows the user to press a button to get the answer (punchline)

## Acceptance Criteria
- User can press a button to get a joke
- When the user sees the joke, they can press another button to get the punchline
- The user can then get another joke by pressing the "get a joke" button

## TASK
- Create a new repo called 'Joke Generator' using the Webpack Template
- Create a wireframe for your application using figma
- Create tickets for what you will do (KEEP IT SIMPLE)
- Use Postman to see your responses from the API
- Build the application
- Deploy the application using Netlify or Firebase
- Update your readme with screenshots and a link to your deployed application

## Finishing Up
- When you are done, submit the link to your README in classTracker
