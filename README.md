For this assessment, you will have until 1:30PM to complete the application.

Using this API: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke, create a joke generator application that gets a joke (setup) and allows the user to press a button to get the answer (punchline)

For those of you who want a more interesting, challenging experience. Here is the documentation on the API: https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api
